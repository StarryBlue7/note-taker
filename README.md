# Online Note-Taker

This is an online note-taking application that uses remote storage for data persistence. It utilizes [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) to handle get, post, and delete requests from the user to the server.

The user can read previously saved notes by clicking their titles on the side bar, delete saved notes by clicking the red trash icon, or add new notes by clicking the `+` button on the navigation bar, then clicking the save icon after entering a note.
